/**
 * ClosureCurried is a wrapper for <code>Closure</code> which transforms a
 * <code>Closure</code> instance that takes multiple arguments in such a way
 * that it can be called as a chain of closures, each with a single argument. <p>
 *
 * This class is normally only used internally, through the <code>curried()</code>
 * method on <code>Closure</code> object. <p>
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * def adder = { a, b, c -> a + b + c },
 *     addCurr = adder.curried()
 *
 * // fails with message: no signature of method doCall() is applicable...
 * // addCurr(2, 3) // ... accepts only one argument
 *
 * assert addCurr instanceof org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.ClosureCurried
 * def add2 = addCurr(2)
 * assert add2 instanceof org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.ClosureCurried
 * def add5 = add2(3)
 * assert add5 instanceof org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.ClosureCurried
 * assert add5(4) == 9
 * </pre>
 *
 * Curried closure has its dual in the form of <code>uncurried()</code>.
 * Since <code>uncurried()</code> is declared in this class, only
 * closures that were previously curried can be uncurried. <p>
 *
 * Example of uncurrying:
 * <pre>
 * def adder = { a, b, c -> a + b + c }
 *
 * // fails with message: No signature of method uncurried() is applicable...
 * // adder.uncurried() // ... needs to be curried first
 *
 * assert adder.curried()(2).uncurried()(3, 4) == 9
 * </pre>
 *
 * <em>Note:</em> this implementation should not be confused with
 * <code>org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.CurriedClosure</code> which
 * partially applies its arguments to a <code>Closure</code> instance.
